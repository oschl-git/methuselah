# Methuselah (beta)
> *Ancient in appearance, this bot's clear eyes suggest a deep wisdom and he radiates strength rather than frailty. He has the calm, knowing authority of someone whoâ€™s seen a few things in his time.*

**Methuselah is a custom bot for the The Long Dark Discord server.** It is mostly used by server staff, though you can also use it for a few things! It even works in DMs. Write `/` and select its icon to see all commands that are available to you. These include:
- `/wisdom` = a simple command which displays lifechanging wisdoms.
- `/remindrule <number>` = reminds you and other members a server rule.
- `/ping` = a testing command to see if the bot works.

The bot is currently in a testing phase, so it can't do much and it might be unstable. Issues might happen. **If you encounter any, or have any ideas or improvements, please contact <@298144223163842560> (@oschl_).**

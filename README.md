# Methuselah 2.0

> *Ancient in appearance, this bot's clear eyes suggest a deep wisdom and he radiates strength rather than frailty. He has the calm, knowing authority of someone whoâ€™s seen a few things in his time.*

**Methuselah is a custom bot for the The Long Dark Discord server.**

It uses the DiscordJS library to interact with the Discord API, and is written entirely in TypeScript. It uses SQLite to store non-static data.

Given the nature of the bot, it isn't particularly useful for any other Discord server, but many of its features and code can be easily adapted for your own needs.

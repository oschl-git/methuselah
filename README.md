# Methuselah

> *Ancient in appearance, this bot's clear eyes suggest a deep wisdom and he radiates strength rather than frailty. He has the calm, knowing authority of someone whoâ€™s seen a few things in his time.*

Methuselah is a custom bot for the The Long Dark Discord server.

## Important notes
- To work correctly, the bot needs to have a `config.json` file in the project folder. It needs to be of the following format:
```
{
	"token": "<token>",
	"clientId": "<application ID>",
	"guildId": "<server ID>"
	"db": {
		"host": "<PostgreSQL server (e. g. "localhost")>",
		"port": <PostgreSQL port (integer) (e. g. 5432)>,
		"database": "<database name (e. g. "methuselah")>",
		"username": "<PostgreSQL username>",
		"password": "<PostgreSQL password>"
	}
}
```
Make sure to never share this file with anyone and put it in your `.gitignore`.
